# TYPO3 Extension to add Turnstile to EXT:form

This TYPO3 extension provides a Turnstile integration for the TYPO3 Form Framework (EXT:form).
Turnstile is a free captcha alternative provided by Cloudflare. It is GDPR compatible. For more information check the [Turnstile website](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/).

We were inspired by an article published on [heise.de](https://www.heise.de/news/Fast-immer-schneller-immer-korrekter-Bots-schlagen-Menschen-bei-Captchas-9240739.html). The article states that bots are better than ever in solving captchas. In 2022, Cloudflare released Turnstile as an alternative to captchas, see [1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/turnstile-private-captcha-alternative/) and [2](https://www.heise.de/news/Nie-mehr-Ampeln-Enten-und-Busse-suchen-Cloudflare-startet-CAPTCHA-Konkurrenten-7279154.html).

# Quick Setup

1. Install the extension and activate it.
2. Add the static TypoScript configuration to your TypoScript template.
3. Get a Turnstile `site_key` and a `privateKey`. Set the TypoScript Constants appropriately.
4. Add a `Turnstile` element to a form.
5. All done!

## Get Turnstile keys for your website

You need two API keys from Cloudflare. Retrieving those keys is free of
charge. Open your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile).
Add a new entry for your website. In order to do so, provide a name of the website
and the domain. This also works for multiple environments, just provide the domain
like `tritum.de`. Any subdomain or local domain will also be supported.

Furthermore, you can choose between three different modes for the challenge.
For more information see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/reference/widget-types/.


## TypoScript Constants

Set the following TypoScript Constants:

```typo3_typoscript
plugin.tx_turnstile {
    settings {
        # Get API keys at https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile
        siteKey = <your-site-key>
        privateKey = <your-private-key>
    }
}
```

## Environment variables

As an alternative to the TypoScript configuration, you can also use environment variables:

* `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`
* `TURNSTILE_PRIVATE_KEY`

# Content Security Policy

If you are using CSP, make sure to adjust them accordingly:

* script-src should include `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`
* frame-src should include `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`
* style-src should include `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`

# Privacy

Make sure to inform your users of your usage of Turnstile and what that means.

# Kudos

A big kudos to [Ralf Zimmermann](https://www.waldhacker.dev/). He is the brain behind the TYPO3 Form Framework and created this extension initially. TRITUM came up with the idea and maintains this peace of fine coding.
